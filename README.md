# black-jack

### Tools and Virtual Environment
The mypy program for checking type hints, and the black and pylint programs for getting to a consistent style. We also looked at the timeit, unittest, and doctest modules for doing essential performance and functional testing. For final documentation of a project, it's helpful to install sphinx. Pipenv is used to keep track of packages.
